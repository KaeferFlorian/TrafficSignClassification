# TrafficSignClassification

We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch to classify images of traffic signs. It is a multi-class, single-image classification using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, C. Igel, Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition, Neural Networks).
